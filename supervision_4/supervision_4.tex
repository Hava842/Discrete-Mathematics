\paragraph{Practice questions}
\begin{questions}
\question What is the number of divisors of $x=2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 11 \cdot 17 \cdot 19$ ?
\question Prove, using mathematical induction, that $n^3 \le 3^n$ for $n \in \mathds{N}$.

\question State the Reflexivity, Transitivity and Antisymmetry properties of the subset ($\subseteq$) operator.
\end{questions}

\paragraph{Core questions}
\begin{questions}


\question Exercise sheet 4.1.2 

Prove that, for any positive integer $n$, a $2^n$ by $2^n$
square grid with any one square removed can be tiled
with L-shaped pieces consisting of 3 squares.


\question Prove that for every positive integer $n$ there exists an $n$ digit number divisible by $5^n$ all of whose digits are odd. 

(Hint: using induction on $n$. If $a_1a_2 \dots a_n$ is divisible by $5^n$ show that one of $1a_1a_2\dots a_n$, $3a_1a_2\dots a_n$, $5a_1a_2\dots a_n$, $7a_1a_2\dots a_n$, $9a_1a_2\dots a_n$ is divisible by $5^{n+1}$.)

\question Excercise sheet 4.3.2 The set of (univariate) polynomials (over the rationals) on a variable $x$ is defined as that of arithmetic
expressions equal to those of the form $\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i$, for some $n \in \mathcal{N}$ and some $a_1, \dots a_n \in \mathds{Q}$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials then so are $p(x) + q(x)$ and $p(x)q(x)$.

\item Deduce as a corollary that, for all $a, b \in \mathds{Q}$, the linear combination $ap(x)+bq(x)$ of two polynomials
$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ is a polynomial.

\item Show that there exists a polynomial $p_2(x)$ such that $p_2(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + \dots + n^2$ for every $n \in \mathds{N}$.

Hint: Note that for every $n \in \mathds{N}$,

$$(n+1)^3 = \sum_{i=0}^n(i+1)^3 - \sum_{i=0}^n i^3$$

\item Show that, for every $k \in \mathds{N}$, there exists a polynomial $p_k(x)$ such that, for all $n \in \mathds{N}$, $p_k(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k = 0^k + 1^k + \dots + n^k$.

Hint: Generalise $$(n + 1)^2 = \sum_{i=0}^n (i+1)^2 - \sum_{i=0}^n i^2$$

and the hint in part (c) above.

\paragraph{Tryhard questions}
\begin{questions}
\question Let $a,b,c$ be positive integers. If $gcd(a,b,c)lcm[a,b,c] =abc$, prove that $gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,c) = gcd(c,a) = 1$. ($lcm$ means \textit{least common multiple})

\question Find all positive integers $n$ such that $3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}|3^n + 5^n$.
