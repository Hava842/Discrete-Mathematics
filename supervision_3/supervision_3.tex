\paragraph{Practice questions (Think about the solution even if you do not end up writing it down.)}
\begin{questions}
\question Exercise sheet 3.1.1

Calculate the set CD(666, 330) of common divisors of 666 and 330.

\question Exercise sheet 3.2.6

Prove that for all positive integers $a$ and $b$,

$$gcd(13a + 8b , 5a + 3b)=gcd(a, b)$$ 

\question Exercise sheet 3.2.2

Prove that for all positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$,

$$gcd(a, c) = 1 \implies gcd(a  b, c) = gcd(b, c)$$
\end{questions}

\paragraph{Core questions}
\begin{questions}
 
\question Exercise sheet 3.3.1.a

 Let $a$ and $b$ be natural numbers such that $a^2 | b(b + a)$. Prove that $a | b$.
 
Hint: For positive $a$ and $b$, consider $a_0 =\frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}$ and $b_0 = \frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$ so that $gcd(a_0, b_0) = 1$, and show
that $a^2| b(b + a) \implies a_0 = 1$.

\question 1959 IMO Problem 1

Prove that the fraction $\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}$ is irreducible for every natural number $n$.

\paragraph{Tryhard questions}
\begin{questions} 
\question  For $n \in \mathrm{N}$, find $\min (a,b)$ ($a, b \in \mathrm{N}$) such that the Euclidean algorithm applied to the pair $(a,b)$ takes $n$ steps to finish. I.e. what is the worst case for the Euclidean algorithm?
 
 \question Let $n$ be a positive integer relatively prime to 6. We paint the vertices of a regular $n$-gon with three colours so that there is an odd number of vertices of each colour. Show that there exists an isosceles triangle whose three vertices are of different colours.
