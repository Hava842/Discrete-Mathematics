\paragraph{Core questions}
\begin{questions}
\question Write step-by-step proofs for the following statements or their falsification.

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $n$ is a natural number larger than 2, and $n$ is not a prime number. Then $2n + 13$ is not a prime
number.

\item If $x^2+y = 13$ and $y\neq 4$ then $x\neq 3$.

\item For an integer $n$, $n^2$ is even if and only if $n$ is even.

\item For all real numbers $x$ and $y$ there is a real number $z$ such that $x + z = y - z$.

\item For all integers $x$ and $y$ there is an integer $z$ such that $x + z = y - z$.

\item The addition of two rational numbers is a rational number.

\item For every real number $x$, if $x\neq 2$ then there is a unique real number $y$ such that $2y/(y + 1) = x$.

\item For all integers $m$ and $n$, if $mn$ is even, then either $m$ is even or $n$ is even.

\end{itemize}
