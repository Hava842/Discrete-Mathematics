\paragraph{Core questions}
\begin{questions}
\question Exercise sheet 2.2.4

What are $rem(55^2, 79)$, $rem(23^2, 79)$, $rem(23 \cdot 55, 79)$, and $rem(55^{78}, 79)$?

\question Consider the statement

$$\forall \text{ natural number }x \text{. } x^{100} - 1 \equiv \prod_{1 \le i \le k} (x-a_i) \mod 101$$

Where $\{a_1, \ldots , a_k \}$ is a finite set of natural numbers.

Find the minimum of $\sum_{1 \le i \le k} a_i$ such that satisfies the statement above.

\question Exercise sheet 2.1.4

 Let m be a positive integer.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Prove the associativity of the addition and multiplication operations in $\mathcal{Z}_m$; that is, that for all $i$, $j$, $k$
in $\mathcal{Z}_m$,

$$(i +_m j) +_m k = i +_m (j +_m k) \text{ and } (i \cdot_m j) \cdot_m k = i \cdot_m (j \cdot_m k)$$

\item Prove that the additive inverse of $k$ in $\mathcal{Z}_m$ is $[-k]_m$.
 
 \end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Tryhard questions (entirely optional, can be difficult)}
\begin{questions}

\question One of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^5$. Find the value of ${n}$ without using a calculator.

\question (This is difficult. Do not prioritize this over other supervision work.)

Is it true that if $p$ is a prime number, and $k$ is an integer $2 \le k \le p$, then the sum of the products of each $k$-element subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, p\}$ will be divisible by $p$?
