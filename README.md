# Discrete-Mathematics

This repository contains the supervision work as well as general information about the Discrete Mathematics supervisions.

## Work

Supervision 1:
TDB

## General information:
Booking
* Try to book at least one week in advance, although I am aware that this is not always possible.
* Book one supervision per 4ish lectures.

Submission
* Written submission in my pigeon hole in Churchill 48 hours before supervision.
* By email 24 hours before supervision.

Why github?
* Easier to manage the work plus you can use the source code and you don't have to latex the questions yourself.
* It is recommended that you subscribe to see the updates in this repo.

Contacting me
* If its a question related to the work, use the 'Issue' functionality on github. This way, everyone who has the same problem can see and contribute to the answer.
* For anything else (such as bookings or cancellations) use email.
* Call me or use facebook if urgent.
