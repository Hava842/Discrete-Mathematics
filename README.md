* Preferred form is a nicely latexed pdf.
* Written submission in my pigeon hole in Churchill 48 hours before supervision.
* By email 24 hours before supervision.

Venue
* Department of Engineering on weekdays.

Why github?
* Easier to manage the work plus you can use the source code and you don't have to latex the questions yourself.
* It is recommended that you subscribe to see the updates in this repo.

Contacting Marton
* If its a question related to the work, use the 'Issue' functionality on github. This way, everyone who has the same problem can see the question and contribute to the answer.
